 ## Overview
A coterie of programmers, Tai, and his merry band of friends who have become minions of the modeling club. Originally formed for the development of WSTube.
There are various ways to read it, such as "Doublesoft", "Wassoft", "Wafu-Soft", and so on.

 AKAGUMI (formerly WSOFT Digital Imaging Lab) produces and supports video and music productions.
 
 As long as we can say with confidence that it is WSOFT's, we do not care what medium it is. In that sense, we are a group of professionals.
If it is not there, it is fine, but if it is there, we will be happy. We want to create such contents. That is the kind of circle we are.
